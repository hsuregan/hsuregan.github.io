					Prior to joining UCLA Radio back in Spring 2014, my knowledge of web development was limited.  I wanted to be part of UCLA Radio because (a) I wanted to share and discover new music, and (b) I wanted to help/learn how to develop a website (UCLA Radio's site was in the process of a complete makeover at the time).  I knew a little bit about HTML/CSS markup, and I knew C++ from taking two introductory copmuter science courses at UCLA, but that was the extent of my knowledge in CS.  
					<br /><br />
					Little did I know how quickly I could pick up languages such as JavaScript and Ruby after having had rigorous training in C++.  Along with HTML and CSS, some knowledge of database languages like pSQL, and Linux commands, these languages would arm me with the tools to make cool websites.  So, with the goal of helping UCLA Radio become the best student-run radio station ever, I learned how to use Ruby, Rails (at the time, we thought that RoR would be best web framework to use for the site), and JavaScript.  While learning how to use RoR, my project eventually evolved into a possible model for how the official UCLA Radio website may work: <a href="http://uclaradio.herokuapp.com">http://uclaradio.herokuapp.com</a>.  Note(!) - It takes a while to load.

					 In a 3-month project during Winter 2014-15, a team of 6 including myself on <a href="http://dailybruin.com"><em>The Daily Bruin</em></a> refreshed the online version of the culture and lifestyle magazine, <a href="http://graphics.dailybruin.com/prime/">Prime</a>. My responsibilities included programming some of the models in the Python Django web framework relating to City Guides, implementing the landing page, and adding some stylizations to the <a href="http://graphics.dailybruin.com/prime/recipes/">Recipes</a>, <a href="http://graphics.dailybruin.com/prime/cityguides/">City Guides</a>, and <a href="http://graphics.dailybruin.com/prime/diy/">DIY</a> pages.  
					 <br /><br />
					 Having already been accustomed to RoR for UCLA Radio, I was able to pick up Python Django with more ease.  Needless to say there are differences, and I found myself preferring one framework's method over the other in doing things.  For instance, I like how Rails placed more emphasis on the controller rather than the models, views, and additional template in Django.  I like how in Django, there is a built in admin home page where you can create new instances of a class through this easy-to-use interface.
