					I think that impressionism is my strength when it comes to art.  I find that there's an element of imperfection that is captured by impressionism - a freedom from <em>strictly</em> adhering to logical models of thinkings - that I enjoy quite from time to time.  From far away, an impressionist painting may be clearly of a building, or of a boat (or in Monet's case, of lilies) - the subject is often tangible - but on closer examination, you'll find a multitude of 'imperfections' that collectively work together.  
					<br /><br />
					Sometimes I think, <em>gee this is kinda ironic</em>, since I'm also an engineer, and can be OCD/think way to hard about the smallest details.  I don't mean to sound closed minded, but I think that part of being an engineer requires an unwavering, and sometimes obsessive attention to detail that I sort of let go of when I'm making art.  Then, <em>shouldn't I prefer hyper-realistic, accurate and precise, photograph-like depictions</em>?  But art is maleable by constitution, and impressionism - for me at least - is more than often a maleable version of concrete things.  There's a playfulness, a liberty from utilitarianism about making impressionist pieces for me, and I find it to be cathartic.
					<br /><br />
					I also have many, I would say, <em>po-po-po-post modern</em>, and 'non-formal' (I suppose), mixed media pieces, <a href="mailto:hsuregan@ucla.edu">contact me</a> if you'd like to see more :).  I sort of <em>lose it</em> when crafting those pieces - they're a lot of fun if I'm feeling super creative - and would prefer to explain the thinking process and method behind the artwork while I'm showing people. 
					<br /><br />
					Oh! Definitely <a href="mailto:hsuregan@ucla.edu">contact me</a> if you'd like some freelance work done.  I'm open to most mediums, and I'm definitely not one to turn down a challenge.
