					I think that impressionism is my strength when it comes to art. From far away, an impressionist painting may be clearly of a building, or of a boat (or in many of Monet's cases, of lilies) - the subject is often tangible - but on closer examination, you'll find a multitude of 'imperfections' that collectively work together.  
					<br /><br />
					Sometimes I think, <em>gee this is kinda ironic</em>, since I'm also an engineer, and can be OCD/think way to hard about the smallest details.  I don't mean to sound closed minded, but being an engineer often requires an unyielding, and sometimes obsessive attention to detail in order to succeed in the task at hand.  Then - and I'm thinking this to myself - <em>shouldn't I prefer hyper-realistic, accurate and precise, photograph-like depictions</em>?  But art is maleable by constitution, and impressionism - for me at least - is more than often a maleable version of concrete things.  There's a playfulness about painting the way I normally do that requires me to step back, to take a breath and to think about the bigger picture, as cheesy as that sounds, and I find it cathartic.  
					<br /><br />
					I also have many, I would say, <em>po-po-po-post modern</em>, and 'non-formal' (I suppose), mixed media pieces.  Drop me a <a href="mailto:hsuregan@ucla.edu">line</a> if you'd like to see more :).  I sort of lose it when crafting those pieces.
					<br /><br />
					Oh! Definitely <a href="mailto:hsuregan@ucla.edu">contact me</a> if you'd like some freelance work done.  I'm open to most mediums and genres, and I'm definitely not one to turn down a challenge.
