			<li>"What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness?" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau">Jean Jacques Rousseau</a>; my favorite philosopher concerning the social contract</li>
			
			<li>Fast forward 200 years and ... “Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter. It's round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies-"God damn it, you've got to be kind.” - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, one of my favorite authors. I find this quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Bless_You,_Mr._Rosewater"><em>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</em></a> compelling because Vonnegut adds an element of brevity to a universal message.</li>
			
			<li>$(document).ready(function(){...}) JavaScript - making things on the browser is one of my favorite hobbies.</li>
			
			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Lane">ব্রিক লেন - Brick Lane</a>, one of my favorite spots in London (my favorite city) along with..</li>

			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Town">Camden Town</a>, where you will find the 'Camden Lock' sign.  I like these places because they're funky and different from other parts of town, and trendy at the same time.</li>

			<li>Chinatown 'Welcome' sign you will find on Grand and Bowary.  Chinatown is my mother's favorite spot in the city, so there is a high probability you will find me there whenever I'm in NY.  The food is so tasty and a great bargain (we're talking relative to Manhattan prices).</li>

			<li>"Finding Nirvana is like locating silence" - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a> from one of my favorite books, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dharma_Bums">The Dharma Bums</a></em></li>

			<li>Performing a convolution integral on the skylines (as if they were graphs) of the two cities I will always call home - Kaohsiung, Taiwan and Austin, TX.  The idea is that the convolution integral in the image will produce another graph that shows the relationship between my two homes, and how that's shapped me. OK - I admit, you would really have to be a nerd like me to understand that... lol</li>

			<li>Manhattan.  The subway system of Manhattan really reminds me of an intricate chip, with people constantly moving around, sort of like how charge moves (current) in chips (<em>you mean like doritos? LOL</em>).  I've also dotted the two places I've resided for extended periods of time in the city, helping shape my overall view of the Big Apple, one of my favorite places to be.</li>

			<li>UCLA, my university.</li>
			<li>LA, modeled after the design of the quilt in Gustav Klimt's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(Klimt)"><em>The Kiss</em></a>.  Los Angeles reminds me of a collection of cities brought together, like a bunch of patches sewn together, and that reminds of the quilt seen in Klimt's famous painting.</li>
			<li>Last but not least, the Figure 8 in Los Angeles.  All I have to say is, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Smith">Elliot Smith</a>.</li>
